# School Catalogue
## Description
 ---
 
 For this project I made a digital school catalogue for the a fictional version of the New York City Department of Education. I got the basic idea and layout of this project from codecademy.
## Install 
---

 I recommend having node installed so you can run the code in your terminal, since there really is not a front-end. But if you are against downloading node you can simply use the inspect tool in your browser.
